This manuscript was submitted to the Journal of Dairy Science for publication in May 2023

All files are either "code" or "data" files. Files named the same correspond to each other. For example, for the "Characterization_Code.Rmd" file, the corresponding data file is "Characterization_Data.csv". The only exception is the "ModeltoThreshold_Code.Rmd" which shares the "ShelfLife_Data/csv" file with "ShelfLife_Code.Rmd"
